Please do not hesitate to contact us!\nAlternatively, provide a PR | open an appropriate issue here\nIf did you like this project, support angular-material-extensions \nby starring :star: and sharing it :loudspeaker:\nDemo\nView all the directives in action at https://angular-material-extensions.github.io/cards\nDependencies\n\nAngular (requires Angular 2 or higher, tested with 2.0.0)\n\nInstallation\nInstall above dependencies via npm. \nNow install @angular-material-extensions/cards via:\nnpm install --save @angular-material-extensions/cards\nSystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for @angular-material-extensions/cards:\n`js\nmap: {\n  '@angular-material-extensions/cards': 'node_modules/@angular-material-extensions/cards/bundles/cards.umd.js',\n}\n\n---\n\nOnce installed you need to import the main module:\n```js\nimport { MatExtendedCardModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/cards';The only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module. The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatExtendedCardModule .forRoot()):\nimport { MatExtendedCardModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/cards';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatExtendedCardModule.forRoot(), ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Other modules in your application can simply import MatExtendedCardModule:\nimport { MatExtendedCardModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/cards';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatExtendedCardModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}Usage\nSupport\n\nDrop an email to: Anthony Nahas\nor open an appropriate issue\nlet us chat on Gitter\nBuilt by and for developers :heart: we will help you :punch:\n\n\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2018 Anthony Nahas.
